* move threshold to config.hpp.
* fix ADC result returning - it should be 10 bit: either read ADCHL or do result<<2.
* decrease threshold, so that detection is done on a longer distance.
* add IR-on vs. IR-off for background light substraction.
* fix hw to use PWM for liting up and fading out LEDs.
* make external power via mini-USB, so that PC-communication can be made + uniwersal power charges can be used.
