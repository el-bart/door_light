# TODO list

* add noise filtering, based on periodical multi-sampling, to achieve proper noise-cancelation while preserving sensitivity
* move to more powerfull ÂµC to squeeze more functionalities
* add LED indicating movement detection
* consider using some small multi-LED-driver, to save space on the board
* consider adding NFC-based configuration of thresholds, timeouts, etc...
